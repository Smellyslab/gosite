# py
a little attempt at making a print function like in python3 just for fun

only current function is

py.Print("")

example:


// ====================================
package main

import "github.com/smellyslab/py"

func main() {
  
  py.Print("Hello World!")

}
// ====================================

// Please Dont Use the RequestGet, or RequestPost function(s) for DDoS or DoS as that was not the intent of the function!
// Thank you for checking out my page aswell i will be making more things for GoLang as i go on.
